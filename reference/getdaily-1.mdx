```kotlin
fun getDaily(type: Connections, 
             startDate: Date, 
             endDate: Date, 
             toWebhook: Boolean = true, 
             completion: (Boolean, TerraDailyDataPayload?, TerraError?) -> Unit = {_, _, _ ->})
  
  fun getDaily(type: Connections, 
               startDate: Long, 
               endDate: Long, 
               toWebhook: Boolean = true, 
               completion: (Boolean, TerraDailyDataPayload?, TerraError?) -> Unit = {_, _, _ ->}){

```

*   `type: Connections` ➡ The Connection to get data from
*   `startDate: Date` or `startDate: Long` ➡ The beginning of the request in either Date or Unix Timestamp
*   `endDate: Date` or `endDate: Long` ➡ The end of the request in either Date or Unix Timestamp
*   `toWebhook: Bool` ➡ Whether or not to send data to your webhook
*   \`completion: (Bool, TerraDailyDataPayload?, TerraError?) -> Void ➡

**Bool** -> If the request was successful or not. If not, a TerraError instance will also be called  
**TerraDailyDataPayload?** -> A payload for each data type. If `toWebhook` is set to true, this returns a class with a property `reference` referring to the payload reference sent to your webhook. If `toWebhook` is set to false, then this returns the entire Terra normalised payload.  
**TerraError?** -> Returned if any error occurred while retrieving data
