# Detailed information on available integrations

## Integrations with special processes

### Google Fit (SDK), Samsung Health: Health Connect (HC)-based integrations

Currently the integrations mentioned above go through the newly developed Health Connect platform, which is an on-device storage system developed by Google. This platform however is still in its infancy, and comes with a number of issues.

> ## ðŸš§Health connect known issues
> 
> We have seen numerous cases of apps not being able to sync into Health Connect due to bugs in the HC platform itself. This could be, for example, Samsung Health not being able to send steps into HC.
> 
> We've also seen cases where HC data simply could not be accessed, for no apparent reason, leading to limited or no syncing of data possible.

For the reasons mentioned above, we _highly_ recommend using the Google Fit integration through the API instead (resource name/enum `GOOGLE`).

### Samsung Health - Direct connection route

As privileged partners of Samsung thanks to their investment in Terra, we have been granted access to their privileged SDK for accessing Samsung Health directly, without using Health Connect as an intermediary.

This route is much preferred to the Health Connect route due to the reasons discussed above. For access to this route, please get in touch with us through our support channels.

### Integrations requiring partnerships directly with the provider

Some of our integration partners require us to have our customers establish direct partnerships with them.
