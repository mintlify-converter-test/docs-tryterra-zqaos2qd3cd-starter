**Instance method of TerraManager**

```swift
getAthlete(type: Connections, 
         toWebhook: Bool, 
         completion: @escaping (Bool, TerraAthleteDataPayloadModel?, TerraError?) -> Void)

```

*   `type: Connections` ➡ The Connection to get data from
*   `toWebhook: Bool` ➡ Whether or not to send data to your webhook
*   \`completion: (Bool, TerraAthleteDataPayloadModel?, TerraError?) -> Void ➡

**Bool** -> If the request was successful or not. If not, a TerraError instance will also be called  
**TerraAthleteDataPayloadModel?** -> A payload for each data type. If `toWebhook` is set to true, this returns a class with a property `reference` referring to the payload reference sent to your webhook. If `toWebhook` is set to false, then this returns the entire Terra normalised payload.  
**TerraError?** -> Returned if any error occurred while retrieving data
