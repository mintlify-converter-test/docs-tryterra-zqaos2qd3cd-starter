**Initialisation**

```swift
Terra.instance(devId: String, 
               referenceId: String?, 
               completion: @escaping (TerraManager?, TerraError?) -> Void)

```

*   `devId: String` ➡ The developer identifier given to your after you signed up on [Terra](https://dashboard.tryterra.co)
    
*   `referenceId: String?` ➡ This is used by you to identify a user from your server to a terra user
*   `completion: @escaping (TerraManager?, TerraError?) -> Void` ➡ A callback function that is called when the TerraManager class is initialised. If an error has occurred in creation, then the completion will return a `TerraError` class. **Highly recommended to wait for this callback before proceeding**
