**Instance method of TerraRT**

```swift
func startBluetoothScan(type: Connections, 
                        bluetoothLowEnergyFromCache: Bool = false,  
                        callback: @escaping (Bool) -> Void = {_ in}) -> TerraBLEWidget?

func startBluetoothScan(type: Connections, deviceCallback: @escaping (Device) -> Void)

```

*   `type`: Connections -> An Enum signifying the connection to make.
*   `callback`: @escaping (Bool) -> Void -> A callback that will be called with `true` if the connection is successful and `false` if the connection is unsuccessful.
*   `deviceCallback`: (Device) -> Void -> A callback that calls with a `Device` object containing the device's name and identifier. You can use this to display the devices in your view (**If provided, all scanned devices will be returned here instead**)

**returns**

*   `TerraBLEWidget?`
