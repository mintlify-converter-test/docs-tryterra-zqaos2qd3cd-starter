title: "startDeviceScan"
---
```kotlin
fun startDeviceScan(
  type: Connections, 
  useCache: Boolean = false, 
  showWidgetIfCacheNotFound: Boolean = true, 
  callback: (Boolean) -> Unit = {_ -> }
)

```

This will pull a widget up to allow the user to scan and connect to a device.

*   type - the \[Connections\] type you are trying to connect to
*   useCache - if you wish to use any devices connected before (will take the first one discovered). Default to false
*   callback - a function that is called with a boolean after the connection is established. The boolean depicts if the connection is successful or not
