**Initialisation**

```kotlin
fun instance(devId: String, referenceId: String?,
             context: Context,
             completion: (TerraManager, TerraError?) -> Unit)

```

*   `devId: String` ➡ The developer identifier given to your after you signed up on [Terra](https://dashboard.tryterra.co)
    
*   `referenceId: String?` ➡ This is used by you to identify a user from your server to a terra user
*   `context: Context` ➡ The context from the activity you are instantiating from
*   `completion: @escaping (TerraManager, TerraError?) -> Void` ➡ A callback function that is called when the TerraManager class is initialised. If an error has occurred in creation, then the completion will return a `TerraError` class. **Highly recommended to wait for this callback before proceeding**
