## Identify Data Schema

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | String | Authentication token generated from the appropriate endpoint. |
| type | Integer | Connection type. Value from the IdentifyType enum. |

## IdentifyType Enum

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| User (Producer) | 0   |
| Developer (Consumer) | 1   |

## Payload Format

| Field Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| op  | Integer | [Opcode](/reference/terra-streaming-reference#opcodes) for the payload. |
| d?  | Object | Event data. |
| uid?\* | String | User ID that the event relates to. |
| seq?\* | Long | Sequence number of the payload. Used when replaying missed payloads. |
| t?\* | String | The [Data Type](/reference/terra-streaming-reference#data-types) for the payload. |

**Key:**  
`? -> Optional field`  
`* -> Only send with payloads of the DISPATCH opcode`

```example payload
{
  "op": 5,
  "d": {
    "ts": "2022-05-04T10:26:11.268507+01:00",
	"val": 95
	},
  "uid": "8e864e3a-979a-4d04-b4e9-b6d020f20ba0",
  "seq": 73,
  "t": "HEART_RATE"
}

## Opcodes

| Name | Value | Description | Sent By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HEARTBEAT | 0   | Fired periodically by the client to keep the connection alive. | Client |
| HEARTBEAT\_ACK | 1   | Sent by the server to acknowledge that a heartbeat has been received. | Server |
| HELLO | 2   | Sent by the server immediately after connecting. Contains the heartbeat interval for the client to use. | Server |
| IDENTIFY | 3   | Sent by the client to complete the handshake with the server. Contains authentication details. | Client |
| READY | 4   | Sent by the server once the handshake has been completed. The client will be able to receive/send payloads immediately after this is received. | Server |
| DISPATCH | 5   | An event dispatched by the server. Contains details about the event, as well as the data payload for the event. | Server |
| SUBMIT | 6   | Sent by the client to notify the server of new data which will then be routed to the correct consumer appropriately. | Client (producer only) |
| REPLAY | 7   | Request a replay of payloads after the given lower bound, and optionally before a given upper bound. | Client (consumer only) |

## Data Types

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HEART\_RATE | `val` is the BPM of each reading |
| STEPS | `val` the amount of accumulated steps |
| DISTANCE | `val` the accumulated distance in meters |
| FLOORS\_CLIMBED | `val` the accumulated floors climbed |
| STEPS\_CADENCE | `val` the amount of steps per second taken by the user |
| SPEED | `val` the speed in meter per second of the user |
| ACCELERATION | `d` the acceleration data of the device.  \- `d[0]` -> acceleration in x direction  \- `d[1]` -> acceleration in y direction  \- `d[2]` -> acceleration in z direction |
| GYROSCOPE | `d` the rotation rate af the device.  \- `d[0]` -> rotation in x direction  \- `d[1]` -> rotation in y direction  \- `d[2]` -> rotation in z direction |
