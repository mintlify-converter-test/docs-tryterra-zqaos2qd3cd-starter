## Usage

### Setup

In order to interact with the Terra API using this library, you need an instance of [`TerraClientV2`](https://tryterra.github.io/terra-client-java/co.tryterra.terraclient/co/tryterra/terraclient/api/TerraClientV2.html)
. This is created using [`TerraClientFactory`](https://tryterra.github.io/terra-client-java/co.tryterra.terraclient/co/tryterra/terraclient/TerraClientFactory.html)
:

```java
TerraClientV2 client = TerraClientFactory.getClientV2("API KEY", "DEV ID");

```

In order to parse and handle webhook requests from Terra, you instead need an instance of [`WebhookHandlerUtility`](https://tryterra.github.io/terra-client-java/co.tryterra.terraclient/co/tryterra/terraclient/WebhookHandlerUtility.html)
:

```java
WebhookHandlerUtility webhookUtility = new WebhookHandlerUtility("WEBHOOK SECRET");

```

### Authentication & User Management

This library does not provide the facilities for directly authenticating a user - you can currently only interact with users that have been authenticated previously.

#### Creating a User object

API request methods of your `TerraClientV2` instance accept both `User` and `PartialUser` objects - this allows you not to make a web request to fetch a full `User` object if you are certain that a user with the given ID exists.

When any API request is made, a new `User` object will be returned with the response. (See [`TerraApiResponse#getUser()`](https://tryterra.github.io/terra-client-java/co.tryterra.terraclient/co/tryterra/terraclient/api/TerraApiResponse.html#getUser())
)

**With API request**

```java
User user = client.getUser("USER ID");

```

**Without API request**

```java
PartialUser user = client.userFromId("USER ID");

```

#### Deauthentication

```java
Future<TerraApiResponse<Void>> resp = client.deauthenticateUser(user);
if (resp.get().isSuccessful()) {
  System.out.println("User deauthenticated");
}

```
