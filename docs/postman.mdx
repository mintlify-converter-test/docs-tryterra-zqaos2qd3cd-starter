title: "Postman Collection"
---
If you are using Postman to interact with the Terra API, you can download a collection of the API endpoints from [here](https://www.postman.com/terraapi/workspace/16728263-411a-420e-9e65-604b6d64d9c2/overview)

On the right, you can export the collection and then import it into your Postman environment. Alternatively, you can fork the collection.

The endpoints are setup with environment variables for your API Key and Dev ID. Under Environments, a template is provided to setup those variables for all the requests made to the API.
