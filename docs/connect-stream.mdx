## Overview

In the Terra Streaming Protocol, a producer connection streams data in real time to the Terra WebSockets service. Any consumer connections formed with Terra can then read this data stream.

The real-time streaming mobile SDKs allow you to connect and stream data in real time from a wearable. It supports data types such as heart rate, accelerometer, gyroscope, steps, calories, and more.

The real-time streaming SDKs have the following functionalities:

*   connect a wearable to your app via BLE, ANT+, etc.
*   stream data to your web backend using a Terra Streaming Producer connection (over WebSockets)

## Supported frameworks

The real-time streaming feature can be setup using:

*   [Native iOS](/docs/stream-heart-rate-ios-sdk)
    
*   [Native Android](/docs/stream-heart-rate-android-sdk)
    
*   [Flutter](/docs/flutter-sdk)
