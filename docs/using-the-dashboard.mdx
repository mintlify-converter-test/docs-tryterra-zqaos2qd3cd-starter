By the end of this guide users will be able to integrate their app with a graph of their data, and know how to manage and edit their live graphs. There are two ways to do this:

1.  Using the Chatbot, where you will talk with your dedicated AI engineer to manage you graphs.
2.  Using our built in UI, where you can select and design your graphs.

In the graphs section of the dashboard you can manage and see your live graphs of the left side and interact with our chatbot on the right.
